Ada layer for Yocto
-------------------

This adds support for building Ada programs under Yocto. This is a work in
progress and more Ada libs will be added in future.

The main branch is for Denzil and GCC 4.6.

To build, you need a GCC that understands Ada, this causes problems for some
systems, i.e. on my Debian testing 64-bit, where the main compiler does not
understand Ada and the Ada compiler has it's own gcc/g++. I was not able to
force Yocto to build using gcc-4.6 and g++-4.6. I had to hack it by compiling
my own GCC-4.6.3 toolchain and fixing the multiarch problems with soft links
to crt[i1n].o and lib[cm].[a|so]. Any hints getting this to work would be
greatly appreciated.

Add thislayer into yourbuild/conf/bblayers.conf file to get it picked up by
bitbake.
